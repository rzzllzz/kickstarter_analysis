## Overview of Project

### Purpose

  The purpose of this analysis was to examine the available data on different Kickstarter campaigns seeking to put on a play. I examined their funding goals and final outcome with the goal of creating a visualization for Louise to use to explain why her campaign came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time as well as for informing her next steps for her play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  A few important conclusions can be drawn from my analysis of the outcomes for theater production Kickstarters based on launch date. The month of May saw the highest number of successful theater productions at 111, followed closely by June with 100 successful productions.

  Following this conclusion, the data suggests that spring and summer months were most likely to have successful theater productions. Thus, a campaign launched between April and June could be a favorable time to launch, as seen in the graph, Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 There are a few key aspects of my analysis of the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns for plays based on their funding goals. There were no canceled Kickstarters for plays. Most plays set goals between less than $1,000 and under $10,000, for a total of 622 within that range. While there were some successful plays with high funding goals, the data suggests that plays saw more success when setting smaller goals.

  Plays with a goal of less than $1,000 saw a 76% success rate, followed closely by plays with a goal between $1,000 and $4,999 seeing a 73% success rate.

  The next highest percentage appears at the much higher monetary value range but with fewer total plays, with plays setting goals between $35,000 and $44,999 seeing a success rate of 67%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  I believe I had the most challenge with finding the correct wording for my written analysis. For example, I found that I was wording my summary of the analysis of the outcomes based on goals as if the percentages of successful or failed or canceled plays represented the whole. While I meant to refer to these percentages as representing the percentage of successful or failed or canceled plays at a given goal range, I found that my wording implied that the percentages referred to the success or failure or cancellation rate of all play Kickstarters. This stemmed from my inexperience with describing data so I took my time verbalizing what I was seeing on the table out-loud to myself to then translate in written form. 

## Results

1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   - One conclusion I can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date is that there is a higher chance of success with launching a campaign during the spring and summer months of the year, with May seeing the most success for campaigns launched at that time. More campaigns are launched during these months, and there is indeed a higher number of these being successful. Another conclusion I can draw about Outcomes based on Launch Date is that almost half of all theater campaigns launched during the year fail or are canceled. 
2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   - I can conclude from the Outcomes Based on Goals that it is likely safest to set a smaller funding goal. There is a higher risk of failure at higher funding goals, however, it might pay off. 
3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
   - Some limitations of this dataset is that it does not take into account the types of support these Kickstarter campaigns might have, such as family and friends pitching in or if the founding party of a campaign has a good reputation and thus garners more attention from donors who believe they are making a sound investment. 
5. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   - Another possible table we could create is a table showing the amount of backers for successful campaigns as well as the inital goal and final pledged amounts. This could provide insight into possible correlation between backers and pledged amounts. Then the goal could be to show the Kickstarter to the biggest audience possible. Or, the data could  show that some campaigns had several large donations from relatively fewer backers as opposed to small donations from a large amount of backers.
